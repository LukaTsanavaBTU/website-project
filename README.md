# Music Website
A website me and my teammate made for a university assignment. The visuals were built from scratch using HTML/CSS, but the main purpose of the project was to implement the backend using Flask. You can browse different albums, which were scrapped from [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) and saved to an SQLite database using Beautiful Soup and SQLAlchemy. You can use the search bar to find the album you like. Furthermore, you can click the album to view more info, which was taken from the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api). You can also log in/register, which enables you to "buy" the albums.<br/>You can check out the live website [here](https://lukatsanava.pythonanywhere.com/home).
